    <h1>How to prevent animal cruelty</h1>
    <p>There are many ways how to prevent animal cruelty.<br/>
    One of those is to teach every person to learn how<br/>
    to love and respect animals because animals know how<br/>
    to love back too. Be a good role model<br/>
    to everyone, especially to children to raise their<br/>
    awareness at an early age. Another is to report sightings<br>
    or suspicions of animal abuse to local animal shelters.<br/>
    <h1>How to take care of the animals</h1>

    feeding them properly, checking their condition if<br/>
    they are okay, maintaining them to be as clean as possible<br/>
    and many more. Taking care of animals is no easy task<br/> 
    but if you love and care for them properly, then they would<br/>
    be loyal and loving to you.<br/></p>
    <h1>Help us raise awareness</h1>
